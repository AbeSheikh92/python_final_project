#### VERSION 1
##### Libraries Used:
1.	csci_utils (Our very own library):
	*Provides access to functionality to preserve file extensions when writing to local targets within luigi tasks*
    *Allows for the of atomic writing to files*
    
2.	nltk (Natural Language Toolkit):
    *Provides functionality to preprocess text data (ex: checking if a word is English)*

3.	genism:
    *Provides access to the Word2Vec model architecture from which the word embeddings will be constructed*

4.	youtube-transcripts-api:
    *Provides an API from which to retrieve YouTube video caption data*

5.	selenium:
    *Provides advanced controlling of web browser functionality and retrieval of HTML elements (especially superior to BeautifulSoup when certain HTML elements are dynamically loaded via JavaScript)*

6.	atomicwrites:
	*Also used in parts of the code to ensure atomic writing to files*
